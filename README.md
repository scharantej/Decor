## Flask Application Design

### App Overview
The user uploads a photo of their home or office corner, which they want to redecorate. The AI interior designer analyzes the photo and provides suggestions.

### HTML Files
- **index.html**: Home page where the user can upload the photo.
- **results.html**: Page where the AI interior designer suggestions are displayed.

### Routes
- **POST /upload-photo**: Route that handles the photo upload and redirects the user to the results page.
- **GET /results**: Route that displays the AI interior designer suggestions on the results page.

### Implementation Details

1. On the **index.html** page, include a file input element for the user to select and upload the photo.
2. In the **POST /upload-photo** route, save the uploaded photo and perform the AI interior design analysis.
3. In the **GET /results** route, retrieve the AI interior design suggestions and display them on the **results.html** page.

### Additional Considerations

- **Photo storage**: Decide where to store the uploaded photos (e.g., filesystem, database).
- **AI interior design service**: Choose and integrate an AI interior design service based on your requirements.
- **User interface**: Design the user interface of the index and results pages for a seamless user experience.
